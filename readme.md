**Introduction**

RequirementsScraper is a software that allows you to scrape engineering requirements from briefs sent by clients. 

Although this application has Australian engineering practices in mind, the backend logic is fairly extensible and may work on a wide number of documents with a little tweaking. 

Currently this application is under development. Check back soon!

**Milestones:**
- [x] Write backend logic
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Revise to pass tests
- [ ] Finalize comments / documentation of backend
- [ ] Begin work on GUI
- [ ] ...and more!

This open source application is developed by Turnbull Engineering.
