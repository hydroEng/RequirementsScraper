**Introduction**

PyEngTools is a collection of python modules aimed at helping civil (and other) engineers automate some of their work. 

This library is specific to the engineering workplace in Australia, and therefore, many of the tools (eventually) written in this library will only be relevant in the context of an Australian engineering workplace. 

**Current Modules**

+ PdfTools - Library for scraping and manipulating PDFs
  + RequirementsScraper - Converts requirements briefs from clients into a trackable excel spreadsheet. 

This open source library is developed by Turnbull Engineering.
